          <h2>Post #01</h2>
          <p>This is my first post so my page isn't completely empty. My intention is to build this site into a webfolio/blog for myself, by combining content that spans my diverse interests I hope to keep myself motivated. On that note I will introduce myself, I'm Jordy a 31 year old Australian, I've been scaffolding the last 8 years including while I studied my bachelors of Design. While persuing my studies at <abbr title="University of New South Wales">UNSW</abbr> I realised my passion lay in development while taking elective <abbr title="Computer Science">CompSci</abbr> courses.</p>
          <p>Since graduating at the end of <time datetime="2022">2022</time> I halfheartedly continued learning in my spare time. I agreed to remain scaffolding for the next 6 months in exchange for some work perks as we were very short-staffed. Since then I've been applying to junior and graduate dev roles hoping to finally transition from construction. That brings me to now, after growing frustrated at my slow progress and lack of much to show I decided to create this webfolio, as a standalone project and a blog dump for my other various interests.</p>
          <p>I'm listing a bunch of my vague intentions for the site below that I may refer back to later when the ispiration or motivation strikes me -</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive Map for a <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> campaign I'm producing (started)</li>
            <li>Adding a tools/utilities page to the site for webapps I create.</li>
            <li>Web-based sourcebook/wiki for the <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> campaign setting</li>
            <li>Purchase a domain for my site.</li>
            <li>Find a cheap web-hosting provider with backend capability.</li>
            <li>Update and add scaffold generator app to my site (I created for a uni project).</li>
            <li>Maintain semi-regular posts (at least one per month would be great).</li>
            <li>Update the site styling ðŸ˜‚ this will likely be dicked with for some time (Bare with me!).</li>
            <li>Theres a good likelihood I'll be transitioning the site to React at some stage too.</li>
            ...
          </ul>
